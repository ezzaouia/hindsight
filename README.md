===================

![HindSight](docs/img/hindsight.JPG?raw=true)

This repo contains the experiment data and code from our [InfoVis '16 paper](docs/feng2016hindsight.pdf?raw=true). 

Data
---
The raw data from our experiments are in the [data](data) folder.

Analysis
---
The R Markdown files we used to compute statistics are in the [analysis](analysis) folder.

Experiment
---
The code for reproducing our web-based experiment is in the [experiments](experiments) folder.

Updates
---
- One data collection error (0 for all metrics) was found in the results of *255 Charts* after the results had been reported, and has since been removed. The corrected data is [255 - analysis.csv](data/255 - analysis.csv). Re-running the analysis led to an minor difference in means, but no significant differences.
